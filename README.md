- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- `start`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `generate <ComponentName>`: generates a new component under `src/components` folder
- `storybook`: runs storybook on `localhost:6006`
- `build-storybook`: create the build version of storybook
